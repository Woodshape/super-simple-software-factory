"""What an agent may CHANGE, enforced in code after the fact.

`tools:` is a capability list, not a sandbox, and two holes make it
unenforceable on its own:

  * `bash` runs anything. A builder handed bash to run a test suite can also
    run `git checkout adws/` — which is not hypothetical: one did, discarding
    uncommitted changes to the very quality check it was about to be judged by.
  * `write` reaches any path, not just the one report file an agent was given
    it for. A reviewer configured with "no edit, so it cannot quietly fix"
    could still rewrite the code it was reviewing.

So permission is verified the way every other claim in this system is —
after the fact, against the repo itself. `snapshot()` fingerprints the working
tree's change-set before an agent runs; `enforce()` compares it afterwards and
fails the phase if the agent touched anything outside its allowlist.

Comparing change-sets, rather than watching for writes, is what catches the
`git checkout` case: a path that was modified before the agent ran and is clean
afterwards has been reverted, and a reversion is a modification. Appearing,
disappearing, and changing all count.

A breach is NOT a gate violation. Gates are for work an agent can be asked to
redo; a breach cannot be corrected by re-prompting, because the write already
happened. It aborts the phase and names every offending path.

Two keys drive it, both in sssf.config.yaml:
    defaults.protected_files   paths no agent may touch unless it names them itself
    agents[].writes      None = unrestricted · [] = read-only · [...] = only these
